# Project: Designed Personal Agriculture Loan (2018 - 2019)

## Findings
- Due to limited financing and banking options in rural areas of Myanmar, farmers and rural families resort to high-interest loans from informal money lenders and neighbors, often pledging their gold and land as collateral.
- Small loans obtained in this manner were insufficient to cover the capital investment needs of agricultural operations.

## Key Achievements
- **Co-Designer**: Initially, I contributed as a co-designer, assisting with research, project management, and the loan design phase to gain a deep understanding of the local agricultural sector, its workings, and the financial industry.
- **Lead Designer**: As the project advanced, I took on the role of the lead designer, refining the loan design to align with the agricultural heat map, which allowed us to understand the agricultural patterns for various crops across the entire country.
- **Loan Design**: Successfully designed a personalized agriculture loan tailored to the cropping patterns in specific zones, matching the income streams throughout the year.
- **Reduced Loan Defaults**: The loan design attracted customers due to its disbursement and repayment patterns that met user and farm capital needs, resulting in reduced loan defaults.
- **Financial Modeling**: Orchestrated the loan model to assess all cost drivers in the loan process, ultimately demonstrating the loan's profitability.
- **Prototype**: The pilot project was successful across multiple zones in the country, with the loan boosting customer income.
- **Delivered**: The loan was successfully launched and serves rural communities across the country, helping consolidate debts and increase income.

## Challenges Faced
- **Research**: Extensive research was required to understand farming patterns across different zones, ensuring the loan design would satisfy customer needs.
- **Compliances**: Ensuring the loan interest calculation method complied with regulatory and reporting requirements was a challenge.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identifying the right target audience and tailoring loan products to meet their specific needs was challenging, given different customer segments requiring different loan terms and features. The creation of an agricultural heat map was instrumental in designing the loan effectively.
- **Market Competition**: The lending market in Myanmar was highly competitive, but the uniqueness of the loan's disbursement and repayment collection scheme resonated with customers, contributing to its success in the market.

This project exemplified my expertise in the financial industry, showcasing my ability to design a credit product and service from scratch and successfully launch it in the market.
